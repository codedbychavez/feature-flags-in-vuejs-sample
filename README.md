# ConfigCat with VueJS
## Application's Functionality:
On load of the app, you are provided a button that asks if you want to calculate your age. When clicked, it sends a status request to [ConfigCat](https://configcat.com) for that feature. If the calculateUserAgeFeature flag is toggled on the configCat dashboard, the feature is enabled for use and an input field appears for a user to calculate their age based on birth year. But if the feature flag is toggled off, a message is displayed telling the user that the feature is currently disabled by the admin.

## This app is a companion application for the [How To Use Feature Flags in Vue.JS](https://configcat.com/blog/2022/01/28/how-to-use-feature-flag-in-vuejs/) blogpost.
